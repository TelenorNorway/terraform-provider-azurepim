# Terraform Provider AzurePIM

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.20

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```

You can also run the `examples/resources/group_eligible_assignment` with the following commands:

```
export TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=terraform-provider-azure-pim/examples/resources/group_eligible_assignment/dev.tfrc

cd examples/resources/group_eligible_assignment
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```
